Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that is caused by the abnormal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Recently, there have been efforts to develop computer-assisted diagnostic tools for MM through artificial intelligence and image processing. These tools require the capture and normalization of images, as well as the segmentation and classification of cells as malignant or healthy. However, the segmentation of plasma cells in MM is particularly challenging due to various factors, such as varying amounts of nucleus and cytoplasm in each cell, the presence of clustered cells which leads to the cytoplasm of two cells touching each other, and the possibility of unstained cells or cytoplasm that blends into the background. We aim to enhance the accuracy of segmentation by applying physical imaging transformations to the raw microscopic images.
We used the SegPC-2021 challenge dataset, a medical imaging challenge on on "Segmentation of Multiple Myeloma Plasma Cells in Microscopic Images (SegPC-2021)"
